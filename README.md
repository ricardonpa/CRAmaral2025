# Creep Rate Model (Under Development)

This repository contains relevant code and data for predicting the `creep rate` as a function of `temperature` and `stress` of refractory high-entropy alloys. The model is developed by Ricardo Amaral ([@ricardonpa](https://github.com/ricardonpa)) and Adam Krajewski ([@amkrajewski](https://github.com/amkrajewski)) and is still under development for publishing.

This model is developed as part of the [pqam package](https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/pqam) for the [ULTERA project](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/design-and-manufacturing-ultrahigh-temperature-refractory-alloys).
